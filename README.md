# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

Welcome to the **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)** repository! This project explores both the fundamental and advanced concepts of GANs, with hands-on implementations of various GAN architectures.

## What is GAN?

A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** is a type of machine learning model consisting of two networks:  
1. **Generator**: Creates synthetic data samples that mimic real data.  
2. **Discriminator**: Evaluates whether a given sample is real or generated.  

The two networks work in opposition, with the generator improving to fool the discriminator and the discriminator refining its ability to detect fakes. This adversarial process results in highly realistic generated data.

## Datasets Used

This repository utilizes the **CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset**, a large-scale dataset containing over 200,000 celebrity images with diverse facial attributes.  

### Key Features of CelebA:
- Wide variety of faces and attributes.  
- Preprocessed images for seamless training.  
- Perfect for experimenting with different GAN architectures.

## What You Can Learn

Inside this repository, you'll find implementations and insights into the following GAN architectures:

1. **Basic GAN**  
   Understand the core principles of GANs, including adversarial training and the minimax game.  

2. **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)**  
   Explore how convolutional layers enhance GAN performance, enabling the generation of high-quality images.  

3. **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)**  
   Learn how to address GAN instability and mode collapse with Wasserstein distance and gradient penalty.  

4. **Advanced GANs**  
   Dive into cutting-edge GAN architectures and techniques, such as Conditional GANs, StyleGANs, and beyond.
